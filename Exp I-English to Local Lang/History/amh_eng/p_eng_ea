Preface
This hand-book of Africa, which is entitled "African Almanac" is the first of its kind to be published in Ethiopia.
Even though it does not contain all details and particulars as "World Almanacs" do, it is believed that the future publications of this "African Almanac" would be complete and detailed, in the proper sense of the word "Almanac."
This year, seventeen African countries have achieved their independence. That is why the year 1960 came to be known as the "African year."
For the same reason, there is no doubt that the year "1960" should be given a special importance in the history of Africa.
Thus, His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, a staunch supporter of African freedom, has ordered that this first "African Almanac" should be prepared as an expression of His deep satisfaction during this "African year," and dedicates the book in honour of the new African Independent countries and of those who are struggling for their independence.

His Imperial Majesty, descendant of the oldest and longest royal line in recorded history, ascended the throne on November 2, 1930, with the title of 'Hail Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia.'
Born on July 23, 1892, at Ejersa Goro, Harar Province, Emperor Haile Selassie is the great grandson of King Sahle Selassie who was a descendant of King Solomon and Queen of Sheba. His father His Highness Ras Makonnen, a hero of the famous battle of Adwa, in 1896, was Emperor Menelik's trusted diplomat and a general of great valour. Upon the completion of His education, during the early years of His age, Emperor Haile Selassie was called upon to serve His country in many outstanding posts, before He, finally became the leader of the country.
He led Ethiopia to become a member of the League of Nations in 1923.
Seven months after his coronation on November 2, 1930. Emperor Haile Selassie, He, of his own volition, graciously decreed the first written constitution and Parliament in the history of Ethiopia, making himself a constitutional monarch.
In 1935, the Italian Fascists launched their aggression against Ethiopia, and in June 1936 Emperor Haile Selasie, before the League of Nations at Geneva, personally pleaded the cause of his country and coincidentally that of international morality. Although the League of Nations put up a deaf ear to his country and coincidentally that of international morality. Although the League of Nations put up a deaf ear to his historic appeal, Emperor Haile Selassie never lost confidence. It was primarily through his wise judgment and astute statesmanship that the day of liberation came, when on May 5, 1941, five years after the Fascist invasion, He rode triumphantly back into the capital of his Empire, at the head of his conquering patriots, with the help of the British troops.
Since the liberation, both in internal and external affairs, His Imperial Majesty has proved to be the dynamic architect of Modern Ethiopia. Upon his return, He found the country in a war-torn condition, ad soon He embarked on a huge programme to give life to the nation. He opened new schools, built modern hospitals, constructed new roads and improved communication facilities. On November 2, 1955, on the day of His Silver Jubilee Coronation anniversary, He of His own will, once again gave a new revised constitution, thereby, granting the country a general election of the basis of universal adult suffrage. Freedom of press and speech is also granted in the constitution.
A staunch supporter of the U.N., Emperor Haile Selassie, inaugurating the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, said, "The United Nations is a living and tangible testimony to the value of cooperative efforts among all men to improve their way of life and preserve peace." Above all, He has committed Himself to the preservation of two principle - "Collective Security" and "independence for oppressed peoples."
A supporter of African Nationalism, Emperor Hail Selassie welcomes and entertains, at his court, many African Nationalists, with whom He exchanges ideas. He has devoted Himself to the cause of African freedom, ever since be returned from Britain in 1941, where be went on exile, seeking outside help against the fascist aggression in His country.
Speaking of African independence, on November 2, 1958, on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of His Coronation, He said, "Time has demonstrated that those Africans, who believed that the existence of an independent Ethiopia would open the door to freedom for all of Africa, were not mistaken in their beliefs.
The family of independent nations in Africa is today growing apace, and no power on earth can now arrest this process."

The Constitution of Liberia is similar to that of U.S.A. The Legislative power consists of two separate branches: the Senate and the House of Representatives, which together form the "Legislature.' Members of the House of Representatives and Senators are elected by a universal suffrage for a period of four and six years respectively. The executive power is vested on a President, elected for a period of eight years, after which he may be re-elected for a term of four years, as many times as the people wish to elect him.
Head of State:  President William V (acanarat) S (hadrach) Tubman. "the Maker of Modern Liberia." took office as President at the beginning of 1944  and has stayed on ever since.
Though his True Whig party has ruled the country since 1870, President Tubman's triumph is counted in Liberia as something very personal.
Liberia, was settled in 1822 by freedom seeking Americans of African origin from 27 American states, the colonization societies being motivated by a great desire to found a Christian nation in Africa.
President Tubman's aim from the beginning has been to weld the many different racial groups into one homogeneous nation. He has traveled extensively in the backwoods (the first president to do so), has given these people the vote and is encouraging them to take a more important part in public life and in the government.
Economically, his hope has been to cram into his 16 years of office "a hundred years of progress and modernization," concentrating on health, public welfare, education, road building and the development of industry, commerce and natural resources. He facilitates concessions to foreign firms whenever they are going to be a benefit to Liberia as well. Industrial undertakings begun under his regime, have transformed great untried areas and galvanized the people into taking a more direct interest in world affairs.
President Tubman, who was born on November 29, 1895, descended from settlers, in known among his people as "Bodor Shad" (Brother Shadrach). Unanimous votes in his favour on big occasions in this one-party country are often described in the Liberian press and "expressions of a nation's gratitude."

UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA

Area: 472,359 sq. miles.
Population:14,418,000 (of which 3 millions are Europeans).
Capital:Pretorin and Cape-toun. Other big towns and Johannesburg. Durban. Port Elizabeth, East London and Kimberly.
Language: Official - English and Afrikaans. The natives speak Bantu dialects.
Government: The governor general represents the Queen of United Kingdom, who is sovereign also over the Union of South Africa. But, in October of this year, a referendum which was voted only by the white population was held to change the status of the Union into a Republic, which will be declared on May 31, 1961. The prime Minister is more powerful and has almost a dictatorial authority.
The government of South Africa is entirely dominated by the European population, mainly composed of Boers (Dutch originated South African whites) and English descendants. The original South African constitution does not guarantee the white supremacy over the colourd people, which the present rulers of the country practice as their main policy. This policy of apartheid is rejected by the coloured people who as a result staged political demonstrations several times: and in March 1960 a brutal massacre of innocent natives was done by fascist whites and militant rulers of the Union. This brutal action was condemned by all peoples of the world.
There are two African Political parties behind the massive resistance against apartheid. These African parties are:
The Pan African people's Congress
African National Congress.
Head of Government: Dr. Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd, 59-year-old Prime Minister of South Africa, is the chief advocate of Apartheid, by which is meant the strict segregation of the 3,000,000 white and 11,000,000 black people of the Union.
To the rest of the world and to the basic principles of human freedom and equality, apartheid becomes inacceptable, but to him (to Dr. Verwoerd), apartheid is designed "for happiness, security and stability, by providing the Bento, as well as the whites, with their own home, language and administration."
He believes it will bring "peaceful co-existence and justice to all people in our beloved Homeland."
South Africa is not, in fact, Dr. Verwoerd's homeland. He was born in Amsterdam of Dutch parents, but the family settled in the Union when be was still a baby.
His early career was spent as a Professor of Applied Psychology, and of Sociology and Social Work at Stellen-bosch University (1927-39).
His introduction to politics came through his editorship of the Nationalist party newspaper Die Transyaler (1937-48).
He entered the South African Parliament as a Senator in 1948, and two years later became Minister for Native Affairs.
For eight years be devoted himself to a series of measures enforcing Apartheid, over-riding hostility from the Africans, from Churches, and from some politicians and businessmen.
As Premier, Dr. Verwoerd has worked to speed the day when his country will become a Republic, a policy now endorsed by a referendum.
By this step, like his "Bantustan" segretation laws, be seea as a move to preserve "This frontier outpost in the Dark Continent."
Dr Verwoerd was shot twice in the head while opening a trade fair at Johannesburg in April, 1960.
Three months later, fully recovered, he said: "We believe we were spared by a Higher Hand, not for our selves but to render a service to the people and to the Fatherland."
Economic Development: The Union of South Africa is well developed agriculturally and commercially. It is the largest producer as well as consumer of necessary materials, in the whole continent of Africa.

Acceptance speech by Prof. William Leo Hansberry
For nearly 50 yyears, I have been endeavouring to search out and correelted and synthesize in a critical and humanized manner the relevant evidence relating to Africa's true position in world history and in world affairs. In the course of this effort, I have been profoundly impressed by the abudance of evidence relating to Africa's storied and unstoried past. But I have often been deeply distressed by the fact that the truie import of this evidence was so little known to the world at large.
I was therefore immensely pleased when I learned that your imperial Maesty had established a Trust which has as one of its primaerey objectives to recogize and encourage those who are devoting themselves to the task of making this vast body of evidence available in convenient from to the world at large. I was especially gratified of evidence available in convenient form to the world at large. I was especially gratified when I lerned that I had been chosen as a recipient of the first Haile Selassie I prize Trust Award for African Research in m y efforts towards this end.
I am confident, your imperial MAjesty, that many of my fellow-Americans and African brothers join me in expressing to you and the Trustees of the Haile Selassie I prize Trust my very deep gratitude for the great honour which you have bestowed upon me for my effort over deep gratitude for the grat honour which you have bestowed upon me for my efforts over the years to asssist in correcting longstanding misconceptions about Africa's proper place in world  history and in world affairs.
May God grant that your great work continue for many years to come.

YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
On this solemn occasion of my extreme happines, I cannot help remembering that repeated affirmation by the many schoars and philosophers, who have contemplated at length on this life of ours "that a span of man's life is somposed of sorrow and happiness alternately".
In saying this, the span of my young life, particularly in my childhood, I do not recall any happiness, except times filled with suffering and sorrow. But now, thanks last few years the fruits of my hard work have brought me appreciation from the one who brought me up and educated me, my sovereign Emperir; admiration from the who brought me up and educated me, my Sovereign Emperor; admiration from the enlightened public at large, and great happiness to me as I have never experienced.
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY,
I humbly beg your gracious MAjesty to allow me to tell those in this assembly. in particular those who witnessed and gave me moral support in my diffcult and sometimes impossible struggles in teh creative field for the dignity and integrity of art. With your gracious permission I was to say to them "I aM INDEED HAPPY TODAY AND THEY SHOULD BE HAPPY TOO!"
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, The patron and protector of Ethiopian, indeed of African Art,
In being the first artist to receive this prize which is highly esteemed and possessing the historic name of your Majesty, I feel  indeed most  honored. May God and history reward you.
Long live the Emperor

YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY!
It is great joy to me to come before Your Majesty and express my throughts, For reasons that agriculture is belived to be Ethiopia's Source of economy, and for my being the award recipient of the Haile Selassie I Prize Trust, my joy is double fold.
Although plantation of coffee- the cause for our award- is a tiring task, we started growing coffee wigthout having enough capital, but with spirit and courage. Under Mr. Costa Alexandrakis, Mr. Guisseppe Galantina and my self collaborated to this venture and now we are granted this honour. Aside from this , the money we borrowed from teh Development Bank of Ethhiopia-established by Your Majesty's farsightedness is the rsult of this honour.
YOUR MAJESTY!
people from teh province I reside in say that , "cofffee kills her owner and rises herself", and I belive that they have good resons for saying this. Allthough it is difficult to use manual power of only few, as has been repeatedly stated by Your majesty, agriculture, and in particular coffee plantation is the step to development.
In any kind of work, there should be moral support. It is when there is such support that one's spirit is aroused. It is our hope-be it for coffee or any other  kind of agriculture- that there will  be many Ethiopian specialists, for their help and advise are needed.
For the privilege in cooperative farms, and in our day and night endevour, I managed to establish a company in my name, and for me to receive an award in the name of the company is a significant example to all private farm investors.
I believe that this award will arouse the urge of thousands of Ethiopias, and inspire them to work, and abolish the idea of saying. "We work, but out work is not recognized". The award is not limited only to the joy of the recipient, but will not b e denied that it is a base to development and prosperity of Ethiopia.
As people form any party of the world with prominent services recive awards from this Trust, I believe that we, Your people of Ethiopia, according to our ability would with spirit and wholeheartedness serive to be participants of international awards.
Long live Your Imperial Majesty!
Long live His imperial Highness!
Long live Ethiopia for every free.

ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY PROF. WOLF LESLAU
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY,
Members of the Board, Ladies and Gentlemen:-I wish to express my profound gratitude to the Haile Selassie I prize Trust for having aganted me the award for Ethiopian Studies. I am particularly happy for having received the award from a country that manifested its intellectual maturity as far back as the 4th century of our era.
Indeed. beginning with that time Ethiopia was able to record its culture, history and religion through inscriptions and literary documents. It is a further a sign of intellectual maturity that the present government of Ethiopia under the leadership of His imperial Majesty Haile Selassie i, Started to take stock of its cultural heritage through the creation of various institutions of research. I am referring to the archeological mission and teh institute of Ethiopian Studies, institutions that investigate the culture of the country in its broad aspects.
It is a sign of intellectual maturity to given recognition to the scientific contributions of those individuals who study the various aspects of Ethiopian culture.The Haile Selassie I prize Trust tiook this initiative.
I am particularly happy that the Haile Selassie I prize Trust by granting the Award for Ethiopian Studies to a linguist has recognized the importance that investigation of the country's various languages holds for our knowledage of Ethiopia's cultural and historical past.
His imperial MAjesty awarding prof. W. Leslau, presented by H.E.

Few nations have achieved this maturity. I hope, however, that the day will come wehen the recipien of this award will be an Ethiopian national, an Ethiopian who will devote his lifetime to the country, the attitude of today's intellectual who studies either at the University of this country or abroad, and the attitude of teh non- intellectual who was curious about my reasons for giving attention to languages such as Chaha, Adare, Selti and Argobba . And when I answered that i did it,, latarik". for history , for research, he understood this reason and gave me his full coopration.
It is this attitude of the intellectual and or the non-intellectual alike that makes us foresee the day when the recipient of the Award for Ethiopia Studies will be an Ethiopian. It is in the hope of having contributed towards the achievement of this goal that I grateful accept eh Haile Selassie Award foe Ethiopian Studies.

Speech By Balambaras Mahteme Selassie Wolde MEskel
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
I am greatly honoured to find myself amongst the prize winners of the Haile Selassie I prize Trust and to receive from your Majesty the Award for Literature.
I was delighted when m y name was announced with those of other winners; my pleasure was even greater when i learnt that the works upon which i had laboured to immortalise the culture and tradition of our country were selected  by teh Committee as my most important contributions towards Ethiopic learning.
The Haile Selassie I prize Trust  has clearly expressed in its publication teh need for and teh value of compiling traditional works, appropriately documented and classifled, and of passing these on teh successive generations, it is indeed very gratifying to find that I have contributed towards this objective.
While it was extremely terrifying to witness the ruthless and barbarous massacre of people and teh destruction of property by teh enemy during the occupation of our country, it was equally distressing to think that tradition and culture might also vanish due to the breaking of the chain in the otherwish smooth continuity of our culture. Furthermore, it was alarming to anticipate that the new generation, readily adopting itself to foreign civilisation, would not k now of our tradition and culture if these were not handed down in writing, and would remain solely under the influence of foreign culture.
It was, threfore, because of this fear that I endeavoured to set aside my personal sentiments, as an author or historian, and sought our elders who had survived teh oppression in order to collect existing writings and subsequently to compile and coordinate all these fragments, often mutilated, so that at last some party of our culture could  be preserved for future generations. The results of my efforts include the books entitled,, Zikre Neger" (Recollections of Bygone Times).,, Yabatoch Kirs" (Heritage from our Forefathers), ,,Amarigna ine" (Amharic Poetry) and,, inkilf Lemine" (Why sleep),. giving a clear picture of our society.
Each of these four books is characteristic: the first shows us that "Our way of life not only reflects our natural abilities but also our tendencies and inclinations", the second that "Most of our proverbs are based on holy writings", the third that "Our poetry is extremely beautiful", and lastly, the fourth that, Our fables illustrate good principles and there is always a moral to be drawn from them".
I feel that I must mention here that I was given sound moral support by the decision of the Ministry of Education and Fine Arts to include the above books in its school curriculum, for which I am deeply grateful, and also for the encouragement and support that I received from friends, teachers and scholars abroad.
In general, our language is rich and beautiful if studied deeply. One word may have several meanings each conveying different ideas.
I believe that the foregoing books, if followed by many other similar works, will give a clear picture of Ethiopian culture.
It is well known that seeking culture from without can make knowledge complete only when it complements the knowledge of one's own. And regarding the knowledge of our own culture, Ethiopia offers a field as rich as it is vast on which to draw. Once our ancestral heritage is reconstructed, nothing would hinder us from making it known to the rest of the world. Thus, it would be expedient for the youth of our country to adopt the motto "We also have it and we are making it known to you". I say this because I know it is the desire of every Ethiopian to see our language and culture propagated.
His imperial Majesty awarding, H.E, Blatten Guesta Mehteme Selassie W.Meskel.
YOUR MAJESTY.
Among the innumerable institutions established by Your Majesty for the development and prestige of Ethiopia, the Haile Selassie I prize Trust is that which offers moral encouragement and a greater cultural life. And, well knowing that the deliberations of the Trustees and their committee of experts are not only of great importance but also very difficult, -- in that the assessment of workers is carried out not through peronal contact with candidates considered, but purely by appraisal of various works through painstaking investigation and review -- I beg Your Majesty's permission to thank, in your presence, The Trustees and all those assisting them in their aduous task.
Long Live His Imperial Majesty
Long Live His Imperial Highness the Crown prince
Long Live Ethiopia in independence.

ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY ATO GEBRE KRISTOS DESTA
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
The prize Trust which has been established through your Majesty's goodwill and foresight will, undoubtedly, encourage many people and open new avenues to wards different kinds of knowledge.
The main aim of human-being is to make his dreams come true on one hand, and to reap the fruits of his toil on the other. Since civilization itself is history it is difficult to see its result within the span of time of generation or two. But to open new roads of civilization is to encourage the present generation and to pave the way in advance for the coming one. Whenever there is a new kind of civilization, it is possible that the voice of criticism is likely to be heard loud. Any new kind of civilization, if not started at the present time, will become strong and difficult to grasp even when it comes after ten years.
These difficulties have been also felt in the field of Fine Arts -- many artists of the past have been neglected and forgotten during their lifetime, but their works have been praised by the second or the third generation. Although the painter reflects the image of his time and expresses things surrounding him, history has represent ones express the beauty of man and his growth and civilization in general. Although as long as he exists on this planet man is the measure of all things, modern man considers himself as the key to a certain kind of knowledge. But he doesn't boast of his perfection and wisdom.
Modern art also follows the same thought -- the artist tries to see the world subjectively; he tries to express nature around him. On the whole, he endeavors to create new ways and means to explain the universe in general. Nowadays, painting is not limited, and is not led into a narrow channel -- instead, it has become a knowledge which moves fast in many different directions. It is this knowledge of research that makes modern art somewhat confusing.
In life as in the creative process confusion has its own laws and symmetry which definer its mere existence -- likewise, abstract or modern art has its own rules and its own language. Until this language is mastered many people might find abstract art confusing. In art, the greatest happiness is work and the result of creation. Modern art, as the classical paintings, doesn't tell stories and show realistic things like the camera does. In the language of modern art the painting itself is an idea; it is the feeling, the thought, and the expression of something. In this twentieth century, when man delves into space and tries to find the meaning of the universe, in painting too, instead of concentrating on himself alone, man sees the world from many different aspects and tries to express the eternal and the universal by creating music in color, line and form.
YOUR MAJESTY,
Like agriculture, industry and economy, which are the backbones of a country, the Fine Arts are gaining importance in Ethiopia -- and the recognition of Modern Art today by this Prize Trust is highly plausible. This prize is for me, until now, the greatest and I honor it. I have submitted to your Majesty my future plan which will be very useful for the development of art in our country -- and I am sure your Majesty will help me.
I thank from the depth of my heart your Imperial Majesty who is the Founder and the Patron of this foundation. I also thank the Trustees and the judges and wish them success in their future endeavor.

Ltd. succeed admirably in both perfecting the extraction process as well as in conceiving,  designing, and building a prototype of the machine for processing, it developed this technique after ten years of sacrifice, hard work, and perseverance. 		Long live Ethiopia.

The achievement of the Company, which presently employees 650 people, has proved to be more than a local industrial success and one of self-sufficiency. Other countries such as the Sudan and buying sacks from Ethiopia and many others are considering the establishment of similar undertakings.

ACCEPTANCE SPEECH BY MR. TULLIO CAMERINO
YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY
The great honor that has been bestowed by the Haile Selassie I Prize Trust upon the group if industrial activities I have the privilege of launching and realizing gives me today the coveted opportunity of expressing to your Imperial Majesty my most heartfelt thanks together with my sincerest respect.
I believe that your Majesty would like to hear from the living, sincere and deeply moved voice of a foreigner working in the freedom of your Empire the expression of gratitude that I feel my duty to extend to all the Ethiopian labor working in my factories. To them, besides to the gracious kindness of your Imperial Majesty and the benevolent consideration of the Prize Committee, I owe the high recognition granted on this unforgettable moment.
From the world of your Imperial Majesty at the time of establishing the Prize Trust, it is obvious that the progress of the Empire of Ethiopia is of primary but not the sole concern of the Ethiopian. He is also concerned with the welfare of the continent of Africa and the whole world as well. It is because of the farsighted and universal concern that your Imperial Majesty has desired that the contribution of Ethiopian citizens as well as foreign nationals living and working permanently in Ethiopia be officially recognized.
The highest summit of world peace, the welfare mankind, mutual understanding between peoples will be reached in the future -- a desirable future -- through work alone. It is work which brings men closer, unit them, and makes them seek together for peace, welfare, and dignity.
It is in work, guided but free, intelligent and qualified , aware and respectful of the human rights that God granted, in work designed to realize the general welfare and unforgetful of the superior aim of the improvements of the individual, that men can hope with good reason to find a peaceful, prosperous and better tomorrow.
Your Imperial Majesty, I most respectfully ask Imperial Majesty to allow me to express here the hope and the wish that not only the prize awarded to me but also the constant benevolence, the high protection and the continuous effort for an ordered progress of this country will make work, loved and respected in the Empire of Ethiopia. May Ethiopia maintain, under the enlightened guidance of your Imperial Majesty, the prominent rank in spiritual and material progress it has attained in these difficult times.
May God protect and bless this country where the work and the initiative of men from every land are respected and helped and may it never fail to have the peace promised on earth to all men of good will.
Chapter 21
The Last Epoch of Menelik- The Conclusion of the chronicle
In Ethiopia the first years of the 19th century were times when many new things were seen and started.
Moreover, Emperor Menilik all of a sudden became ill and started to become weak although he deserves appreciation for bringing civilization.
With regards to education his attempts so as to make his country's people assiduous, and to enable them understand the value of education and start learning could be seen form the strict proclamation he issued.
"Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah Menelik II Emperor of Ethiopia" up to now anyone with a skillful hands to do thins used to be called names, therefore, nobody used to work hard to learn and train.
If we line with such harmful situation, churches would be closed, above all, Christianity wouldn't e found.
In other countries not only would they learn each thing, but they also do new things.
Therefore, let all boys and girls enter school offer their six years of age.
Families who are not attentive to teach their children, when the parents die their properties would the transferred to the government, instead of to their children.
It's my government which prepares students and teachers.
, Emperor Menelik".
The issuance of this strict proclamation of confiscation of ownership of land and property is one doesn't comply with education legislative decree showed his great intention with regards to education.
So, for the first time, to start European education, he brought teachers form Egypt an opened a school which is called up to now in his name the Menelik II school in 1908.
He did this thinking that it is the first road for a nation's civilization.
During that time, unless one wanted to use it for clerical services in the church or to be a writer, no one took the skills of reading and writing seriously.
Indeed there were many important things that used to be improved and established.
However, he didn't get enough time for other things and improve greatly the administration apart from developing a nation at a time of war, protecting the enemy that came and establishing peace to his people.
Out of what we callas Menelik's peaceful era, the years after the Adowa war, 6 years were the time when emperor Menelik was obliged to stay at home due to illness, and as a result, his natural diligence and strength became weakened and hindered most of the work.
The first feeling of weariness and illness seemed to have started around 1905.
At a time of consultation meeting, a feeling of boredom was seen on him rather than the usual alertness and motivation for work and understanding with patience.
His strong body seemed to have become wearied.
His main intention was to transfer in a strong base to his grandson whom he fostered, the one Ethiopian government which was a stable territory of state which he toiled for years and established.
Hence, in 1909 he gathered his main governors, army officials and lords before Bishop Mathewos and have them vowed that his grandson Honorable son Iyasu was to be the heir so that they wouldn't betray him.
After that the 6 years up to his death were emperor Menelik's time of illness.
When he was caught by illness he was 67 years old.
During this time of illness, impress Taitu tried her best to seize power.
Nevertheless, the emperor, army officials like Tesema and Habte Ghiorgis who were obedient servants an other lords of the house were seriously opposed the idea of her taking power and so the empress' wish wasn't fulfilled.
Prince Mekonnen whom Menelik likes and trusts as his own son and who expands the Harar Province and whose name is mentioned as a hero during the Adowa war died earlier in 1906.
Army official Tesema, too died at a time when emperor Menelik was seriously ill in 1911 just before the emperor's death.
Emperor Menelik who had done all great things in history and unforgettable, the skills of which he brought about were worthy an glittering like a diamond, was forced to patiently hear in his illness unto death in 1914 things that were being done in his government, which may probably be against his will.
In his 35 years of power, he over came very difficult situations with luck patience and wisdom.
His time of power had a lot of struggle and needed great sacrifice and de void of repose.
In this struggle, he was able to receive the prestigious crown of history through his accomplishment, in being able to combine the wishes of the two heroic kings, Emperor Tewdros, who wished to make Ethiopia one, and Emperor Yohannes, who displayed a great love for his country, and in doing so, Menelik could make Ethiopia wide and strong.
After this what remained was through following his steps holding fast and preserve what he struggled and toiled for.
Emperor Menelik also was a fair judge, that was expected from a king above any other work, who loves straight and truthful things, and who properly punished the wrong doer, and for the one who was done wrong, he kept it rights.
He was also popular for his generosity to the poor and being compassionate supporter.
He was a king who used to say in Ethiopian land, after the right land measurement had been make with a long leather or rope, "If during my reign, anyone doesn't take hold of land and those who preferred to get in to your province of birth, you'll remain without land as well as remain staying where you are."
So, due to his generosity and mercifulness, he used to be called by the name a compassionate mother is called and an unforgettable title among his people "motherly Menelik".
The priests, merchants and farmers whom Menelik used to give mantle, soft palate-horse, mule, silver, and oxen and cows, though officially his death, was obscured after December 11, 1914, his people knew from hearsay that he had passed away , and so they used to compose averse at every work place.
The Empress' Time of Banishment
On April 11, 1911 Tesema the Duke died of a sudden illness.
Since the Honorable son Iyasu was only fifteen then, he was the heir of King Menelik, he started ruling Ethiopia independently.
Nevertheless, being aware of his lack and maturity of administration he chose some of the royal family members to help him, but with regards to sharing counsel it was told that they didn't have the skill and the strength.
(Based on the conventional generation live Taye Gulelat, next to Abeto Iyasu, was by far capable than any other members.
Look at the Honorable child Mahtemeselassie woldemeskel Hulke, Generation of the Royal Family of Sahleselassie, table (2nd line).
Abetu Iyasu, after ruling as being a plenipotentiary, in order to avoid the prophecy that "a queen would arise after king Menelik", he reminded queen Taitu to altogether get out of the Palace and stay at Intoto in banishment, (After seeing the political clash that was going on in Addis Ababa, especially the activities of General Ayalew, who was observed by Lord Michael as being opposition to his son's authority, he was expecting serious measures to be taken against him; in contrast, he was not only released from his arrest but also given promotion at Kembata town, which left him an aching void.
Instead of this, when it is looked at from the matter that led them to have strong desire to oppose the ‘empress' relatives, it is possible to estimate the reason as to why the long-standing conflict with Lord Wole was tight with regards to the matter mentioned above).
Because Abeto Iyasu had not entered the palace queen Taitu spent few months there and on the fifth day of July according to the command was decided to make her move to Entoto.
(At the time Lord Wole consulted his followers to go to Addis Ababa the army leader General Yimer explained his readiness to war for the he said how could we keep silent while the Queen is deposed from her authority.
Lord wole was quoted saying along with the criticism and explained that war was wrong "How could I dismantle the government I built with menelik".
Honorable son Desta Aleme, Zini Kemahu).
Before she started her journey on Thursday, she entered the drawing room where her husband's corpse laid to rest next to St. Mary church, at 4 o'clock in the morning.
The death of Emperor Menelik was not disclosed to the public because General Habte Giorgis consulted them not to.
Unable to control her tears, the Empress said, "I have already put aside my harvest, what do I have here, my lord! I will also follow you in my time," and cried.
The people who were around her were touched by her sorrow.
And started crying.
The sorrow over the death of menelik has not yet been forgotten form the side of the people, and the additional eviction of empress Taitu from the palace was thought to induce the mourning, so the nobility, the lords and the honorable ladies wiped their tears and sympathized with each other so as to keep the secrets that has been kept as yet and not letting it out to the public at this coincidence.
Just at five o'clock the candle that was moistened by bees wax was flickered by the butlers like torch sparkling on the area, surrounding the empress making her ready for the journey.
The commander of cavalry brought the empress' mule.
The mules of the nobility, the lords, the honorable ladies and the thirty-nine ladies of the bed-chamber, were outside the premise of the palace waiting for the arrival of the empress.
As the empress started her journey accompanied by her butlers and servants, all followed her with their mules.
When ever she feels tired the journey would break, she would ride off the mule and would sit on a chair that is given to her for taking some rest, and after a while continue the journey.
After traveling seven chapters and reached Intoto area, and a field named Usher Tezazu, a carpet was laid for her honor and on it was a sofa where she laid for a while.
The men welcomed her with cheering while the women with cries of jubilation.
The priests with their ordination out fits and choirs rhythmically danced with the church song.
As soon as the welcoming ceremony was completed the honorable journey continued in high spirits the music that came out of the large wind instrument like a fife, a single-string violin and the harp loudly played accompanying it.
The parade was large.
However, the death of king Menelik which was kept secret was feared to bring about chaos due to the excessive number of the army.
Yet, the people who realized the empress' journey to Intoto expressed its heartfelt sorrow and has no other idea, the Empress appreciated and said, "we really have people" which revealed the love of the people.
As soon as she reached the Intoto palace, she invited the nobilities, lords, honorable ladies and all those army who were gathered there with a feast for the time coincided with the end of June which was also the end of "the apostle's fasting".
During the time of her banishment, for a year and six months and twenty-two days, her loyal servants and all the army didn't rob her from princlliness.
The nobility, the lords, the honorable ladies too were dropping by her day after day giving the appropriate prestige and honor.
Even Abeto Iyasu used to go and see her taking various gifts.
(In Ethiopian government administration it's known that kings used to chose and empower their consultants and for this there was an old proverb that says "A king without consultant would never reign for more than a year".
After the few dates of reminding, the uncle of Mr. Zewditu, governor Weldegiougis' land was seized by they order of honorable son Iyasu, and come to Empress Taitu asking her for being a go-between.
The empress sent the honorable kebede Adenew to honorable son Iyasu who by then used to live in his father, Duke Michael's premise, and the lather bowed his head and gave her message, and promised that he would make the release of his land effectual.
Afterwards, "Does she ever mention me?"
What did she say about me?
He asked and the messenger replied "yes she mentioned your name" and when he asked "how does she mention my name?" and the messenger replied, "he's my son, and I'm his mother and you're his sister and why didn't he visit us? What did we do to him?" and feeling regret, the honorable son Iyasu told her that he would come "Tomorrow afternoon" and she went off with this message.
On the morrow Empress Taitu was waiting him with Mrs. Zewditu, and honorable son Iyasu came as he said, and at first, the food-table was ready before the empress and Zewditu so honorable son Iyasu asked as to where his food-table was; the empress showed him hers and since he was not so happy to eat with one food-table with the empress, the empress quickly reminded him that we were to feel unhappy to eat with you in one food-table for, not you for you are not the king or queen, so they ate with one food-table and he received thank son the release of the land, and honorable left out.
After wards, the empress who was impressed by her messenger's skill apart from properly delivering the message sent by the empress his deeds to tactic fully bring them closer, asked "where on earth, for Christ's sake, did you get such a diligence" to which he replied "God pointed out for me" he said.
(Honorable Kebede Adenew, Zini Kemahu, July 5, 1980)
If we mention, for instance, the minister of defense, General Habte Ghiorgis bringing gifts of as many oxen, honey and butter, bowing and showing his obedience to her.
Since the empress knew the role he played in the conspiracy against her he came to visit her for the first time since she was banished here less than month ago and she asked him "Habte Giorgis When did you start liking me?"
"You have me placed under an interdiction not to get in to my original dwelling place" and added other wards of criticism.
The General in his very witty and wise nature.
I made consultation with the lords so that you should not go to your region.
It's to protect us from being blind.
If you go what kind of eyes, and what light do we have, I thought about Ethiopia.
And as to you, what other, who made things stable? It's you! He replied.
Interview of Priest Mekonnen and the Wiseman Abebe Worede and all who were these on September 29, 1972)
After listening patiently and attentively to him, and reflecting on it for some time, realizing that with the participation of authority others would gain political experience that help the country, she said, "Habte Ghiorgis, you convinced me! Thank you very much!" and order her servant to receive his gift.
Since on the occasion of the General's visit a feast was ready to invite the people, the lords gather together and came to the hall where the empress was located, and enjoyed the banquet.
At this juncture the empress gave farewell to general HabtetGhiorgis saying "Don't leave me, visit me".
Nevertheless, the Empress Taitu's yoke of banishment was lifted with less than three months' time.
The reason for this was Honorable son Iyasu's government could stay long and in September 1917 the cabinet of ministers Mrs. Zewditu Menelik coronated Empress Zewditu and was made to substitute and lead the government.
However, the mother Empress thought of honorably returning to the former palace would make her standard low and so preferred to stay at her palace in Intoto.
(What's termed as the fasting of the apostles and be broken on July 13 commonly called the fasting of June.)
After Empress Zewditu came to power, she loved and respected her more than any other time, historians told.
After she became Empress, she had to stay in the palace inviting and talking to guests for a month.
But after a month, she went to Intoto Palace to pay a visit to Empress Taitu.
After reaching there and met the mother empress, as she tried to bow and salute her, Empress Taitu reminded her that the crown of Ethiopia Empress Zewditu had on her head was more respected and at that time this kid of salutation would rather be done by her for it was her turn to do so, and there fore, mother the empress stood up and kissed her, it was told.
While Empress Taitu were at Intoto, she used to pray day and night wishing Ethiopia not to fall at some fault.
She used to offer her advice for the occasional request of government affairs.
For this it would be exemplary to mention what she contributed in October 1917 when the king of Wollo, Michael, opposing his son's Honorable Iyasu's deposition from his power and eviction, called for his army fro war against the new regime; as soon as this was heard the nobilities and lords of Shoa region said let's fight region going to Wollo, but General Habte Ghiourgis preferred to go to the Empress to Intoto an consult her before that.
"You didn't take a wise decision for the land of Wollo is by nature barricade, so you'll have killed so many people.
Armies from Wadla Delanta area would attack you so by hook or crook bring them to Shoa, Michael is a hero, he's hasty and he'll come," she gave her wise advice.
Honorable Iyasu in his short-term office went to different regions.
The main causes for his downfall were (1) frequenting strict control, warning demotion and even punishment of death on higher officials (2) doing things that are not expected of his standard, and committing injustice, (3) not only didn't have close relation ships with officials and lords, but also didn't give due respect to elders, (4) participations which made him be suspected to have changed his religion to Islam, etc...
The several officials who were displeased by Honorable son Iyasu's administration raised these points and exaggerated, it by saying that, according to the international situation before world war I, the honorable son Iyasu has an agreement of ammunition purchase with Austria, who was an ally of Nazi, Germany, and had discussions with embassies of Germany, Turkey governments, while the British and French governments were following the matters attentively.
And later using photographic techniques, put honorable Iyasu under Muslim cultural outfits, disseminated these photos which contributed for his down fall.
In addition, an Armenian, father Mussie Leon and the owner of Cinema Empire was said to go to Egypt and brought 20,000 copies of the photograph.
Mussie Kachik Zeni Kemahu, april 1980.
The nobilities and the lords being guided by the war strategy given by the empress, were waiting for King Michael, and as she said he came to Shoa traveling day and night, where General Habte Ghiorgis fought him at a place called Segelle Meda with his army of Shoa in a few days and became victorious, taking captive of the king, history remind us.
On the other hand, as has been mentioned above, Empress Taitu apart from sharing ideas and practically supporting Emperor Menelik, after the Emperor's death she didn't stop offering advice to Empress Zewditu from her banished area, Intoto, so as to guard her commands from going out of balance and sustain her authority.
It was known that Emperor Menelik was sick and even after his assign away, the time became a transition and numerous power rival cries put Ethiopia in great controversy and this would make her a weak country, and since this was a great opportunity for a foreign enemy who would like to split up the country, she was very worried.
Because of this, time and again through the messages she used to send by her confidantes, she was advising ways of Empress Zewditu to strengthen her power, her special secretary who is still alive, Honorable son Desta Aleme, speaks.
